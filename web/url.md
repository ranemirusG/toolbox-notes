# URLs
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
is the more modern and correct name for them. The syntax is defined in RFC 3986.

URLs start with the “scheme”, which is the official name for the http:// part. That tells which protocol the URL uses. The scheme identifier is separated from the rest of the URL by the :// sequence
