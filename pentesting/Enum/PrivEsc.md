# Privilege Escalation

When the time comes to escalate our privileges, we don't necessarily need to immediately escalate to Domain Admins because there may be other accounts that have higher privileges than a regular domain user, even if they aren't necessarily a part of the Domain Admins group.

Service Accounts are a good example of this.

Although they may not always have the highest privilege possible, they may have more permissions than a regular domain user, such as local administrator privileges on specific servers.

In addition, an organization's most sensitive and important a data may be stored in locations that do not require domain administrator privileges, o that obtaining domain administrator privileges a should not always be the end goal during an assessment since we may be able to reach R the "crown jewels" for an organization via other users in the domain.




## Chained compromise
When an attacker or penetration tester improves access through multiple higher-level accounts to reach a goal, it is known as a chained compromise.
