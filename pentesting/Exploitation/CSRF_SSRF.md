# Cross-Site Request Forgery and  Server-Side Request Forgery


## CSRF (or XSRF)

The attacker causes the victim to carry out an action while authenticated.



3 key conditions must be in place:

- A relevant action. There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).

- Cookie-based session handling. Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.

- No unpredictable request parameters. The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.




### Prevention

- CSRF Token

- SameSite Cookies





### Examples:
	- changing their email address
	- transferring funds
	
	
	
	
### Bypassing referer


append in the form of a query string
`Referer: https://arbitrary-incorrect-domain.net?YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net`


many browsers now strip the query string from the Referer header by default as a security measure. To override this behavior and ensure that the full URL is included in the request, go back to the exploit server and add the following header to the "Head" section:

`Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url` (the word "referrer" must be spelled correctly in this case)






Example:
```
<html>
    <body>
		<script>history.pushState('','','http://localhost:4280/vulnerabilities/csrf'</script>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<a href="http://localhost:4280/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=test&password_conf=test&Change=Change">Go to page</a>
    </body>
</html>
```
