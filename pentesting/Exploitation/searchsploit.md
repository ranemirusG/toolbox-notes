# SearchSploit - Exploit Database Archive Search

Search through exploits and shellcodes using one or more terms from Exploit-DB

- <https://www.exploit-db.com/>
- <https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit/>

The Exploit Database repository is the main core of Exploit-DB

## Set up
-u, --update
Check for and install any exploitdb package updates (deb or git).







## Search
By default, searchsploit will check BOTH the title of the exploit as well as the path.
Searches can be restricted to the titles by using the `-t` option.


Remove unwanted results by using the `--exclude` option.

--id
Display the EDB-ID value rather than local path


--www [term]
Show URLs to Exploit-DB.com rather than the local path


-j, --json [term]
Show result in JSON format



### Automation
--nmap [nmap_output.xml]
Checks all results in Nmap's XML output with service version











## Use / copy the exploit(s)
Once we have found the exploit we are looking for, there are various ways to access it quickly.

-p, --path [EDB-ID]
Show the full path to an exploit (and also copies the path to the clipboard if possible).

-m, --mirror [EDB-ID]
Mirror (aka copies) an exploit to the current working directory.
