# Cross-Compiling Exploit Code

To avoid compilation issues, it is generally recommended to use native compilers for the specific operating system targeted by the code.
In some scenarios, we might only have access to a single attack environment (like Kali), but need to leverage an exploit coded for a different platform.




## mingw-w64
`sudo apt install mingw-w64`

Compile the code into a Windows Portable Executable (PE)

The first step is to determine if the exploit code compiles without errors by just compiling:
```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe
```

If something goes wrong during the compilation process, Google search for the error(s).
