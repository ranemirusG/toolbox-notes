# Exploits

A common process of a penetration testing engagement is the use of publicly available exploits, and searching for appropriate exploits becomes a critical skill when this need arises.





## Online resources

### SearchSploit - Exploit Database Archive Search

Search through exploits and shellcodes using one or more terms from Exploit-DB

- <https://www.exploit-db.com/>
- <https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit/>

The Exploit Database repository is the main core of Exploit-DB
- <https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb>



### Set up
-u, --update
Check for and install any exploitdb package updates (deb or git).




### Search
By default, searchsploit will check BOTH the title of the exploit as well as the path.
Searches can be restricted to the titles by using the `-t` option.


Remove unwanted results by using the `--exclude` option.

--id
Display the EDB-ID value rather than local path


--www [term]
Show URLs to Exploit-DB.com rather than the local path


-j, --json [term]
Show result in JSON format



#### Automation
--nmap [nmap_output.xml]
Checks all results in Nmap's XML output with service version




### Use / copy the exploit(s)
Once we have found the exploit we are looking for, there are various ways to access it quickly.

-p, --path [EDB-ID]
Show the full path to an exploit (and also copies the path to the clipboard if possible).

-m, --mirror [EDB-ID]
Mirror (aka copies) an exploit to the current working directory.





### Packet Storm

Is an information security website that provides up-to-date information on security news, exploits, and tools (published tools by security vendors) for educational and testing purposes.

## Exploit Frameworks

An exploit framework is a software package that contains reliable exploits for easy execution against a target.
These frameworks have a standardized format for configuring an exploit and allow both online and offline access to the exploits.
This section will cover some popular exploit frameworks.


- Metasploit
- Core Impact (paid) https://www.cobaltstrike.com/product/core-impact
- Canvas (paid)
- The Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) is a penetration testing tool focused on client-side attacks executed within a web browser.https://beefproject.com/
