# Exploitation



## Client-Side Attacks
Is an attack vector that involves coercing a client to execute a malicious payload on their system that consequently connects back to the attacker when executed.

Typically utilize various social engineering techniques like generating malicious documents or portable executables (PEs).

Take advantage of human vulnerabilities as opposed to vulnerabilities in services or software running on the target system.


Given that this attack vector involves the transfer and storage of a malicious payload on the client’s system (disk), attackers need to be cognisant of AV detection.






## Host-Based Attacks / System-Based Attacks

System/Host based attacks are attacks that are targeted towards a specific system or host running a specific operating system, for example, Windows or Linux. Involve exploiting misconfigurations and inherent vulnerabilities within the target OS.

Usually come into play after you have gained access to a target network, whereby, you will be required to exploit servers, workstations or laptops on the internal network.

Unlike network based attacks, host based attacks are much more specialized and require an understanding of the target operating system and the vulnerabilities that affect said operating systems.

APTs
	refers to threats that demonstrate an unusually high level of technical and operational sophistication spanning months or even years. APT attacks are associated with social engineering and are often conducted by highly organized groups of attackers.

## Network-Based Attacks


### STP manipulation
Spanning Tree Protocol
tipo de ataque de capa 2 hace que un host aparezca como el root bridge de una LAN



### DoS / DDoS
	A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a network resource consumption attack that has the primary goal of preventing legitimate activity on a victimized system. Attacks involving numerous unsuspecting secondary victim systems are known as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. 
fragment attacks
oversized packet attack


### SYN Flood
El atacante envía enormes solicitudes de conexión (SYN) pero nunca envía un reconocimiento de regreso al servidor. Esto hará que el servidor espere cierto tiempo y mantenga la conexión. Esto consumirá todo la capacidad de conexiones simultáneas en el servidor de destino haciéndolo inaccesible para usuarios legítimos.




###  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) / man-in-the-mobile (MitMo)/ on-path attack

Attackers place themselves between two devices, often between a web browser and a web server, to intercept or modify information that is intended for one or both of the endpoints

DNS spoofing, also known as DNS cache poisoning, where an attacker redirects queries to a fraudulent DNS server, subsequently leading users to malicious websites by returning false IP addresses. The BEST security measure to mitigate this risk is to implement DNS over HTTPS (DoH).



#### Spoofing

	An attack with the goal of gaining access to a target system through the use of a falsified identity. Spoofing can be used against IP addresses, MAC address, usernames, system names, wireless network SSIDs, email addresses, and many other types of logical identification.

network sniffing/monitoring

ARP spoofing,
	un atacante envía mensajes ARP falsificados a través de una red de área local (LAN) para vincular la dirección MAC de un atacante con la dirección IP de una computadora o servidor legítimo en la red.

DNS spoofing
	 desviar el tráfico de Internet de servidores legítimos hacia los falsos.
	 
DNS Tunneling

session hijacking

SSL stripping






### Side-channel
	is a passive, noninvasive attack to observe the operation of a device. Methods include power monitoring, timing and fault analysis attacks.





















## Password Attacks


Password Spraying
	This technique attempts to gain access to a system by ‘spraying’ a few commonly used passwords across a large number of accounts. For example, a cybercriminal uses 'Password123' with many usernames before trying again with a second commonly-used password, such as `qwerty`


Brute-force Attacks
	Attempts to determine a secret by trying every possible combination.

Credential stuffing
	is a cyber attack in which credentials obtained from a data breach on one service are used to attempt to log in to another unrelated service.
	
Dictionary Attacks
	 Uses pre-selected	 list of options. Rather than trying every option, only try complete options which are likely to work.

Rainbow Attacks
	Is generally an offline only attack.

Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
	Use of compromised password hash to authenticate and gain access to other systems on a network. Instead of cracking the hashed password, the attacker simply passes the hashed value to authenticate, bypassing the need to know the actual password.

## Hardware Attacks

Rowhammer
	By repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit triggers electrical interferences that eventually corrupt the data stored inside the RAM.


Google security researchers discovered Meltdown and Spectre, two hardware vulnerabilities that affect almost all central processing units (CPUs)
























## Social Engineering
Tactics to infiltrate systems via email, phone, text, or social media, often impersonating a person or agency in authority or offering a gift. A low-tech method would be simply following someone into a secure building. 

### SEO Poisoning
	The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or attempt social engineering

### phishing
An attack that attempts to misdirect legitimate users to malicious websites through the abuse of URLs or hyperlinks in emails could be considered phishing.

Spear phishing: specific target

Whaling Attack:  attempt to trick highly placed officials or private individuals with sizable assets into authorizing large fund wire transfers to previously unknown entities.
