# Buffer Overflow

A buffer is a memory area that holds content.
Some buffers have a dynamic size, while others have a fixed, preallocated size.


A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs whenever the user's provided content goes beyond the stack limit and overruns into the adjacent memory area.

Memory corruption vulnerabilities can occur in different parts of a program such as the heap or the stack.






Example:
```
*buffer[64]*
...
strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
```
This function is marked as unsafe since it does not check if the destination address has enough space to fit the originating string.

The stack makes room for the exact space needed by the buffer (64 bytes in our case), along with function parameters and the return address. The return address is a memory address that stores the next function to be executed once the one running has completed.

If the user's input is bigger than the destination buffer's space, it could overwrite the return address.















A typical buffer overflow attack scenario involves overwriting the return address with a `JMP ESP` instruction, which instructs the program to jump to the stack and execute the shellcode that has been injected right after the beginning of the payload.
