# PowerShell






The `-enc` parameter stands for "encoded command".
It allows you to run a PowerShell command that has been encoded into a base64 string. 
This can be useful for executing commands that might be too complex or contain special characters that could be problematic in their raw form.

```powerhsell
# Original command
$command = 'Get-Process'

# Encode the command
$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($command)
$encodedCommand = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)

# Run the encoded command
powershell -encodedCommand $encodedCommand
```
