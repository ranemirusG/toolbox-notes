# Difficult situations


I'm a little nervous
Bear with me (be patient)
Give me a moment
It's on the tip of my tongue.

I had something I wanted to say, but I've lost it. Hopefully it will come back.



My apologies. I've completely forgotten your name.





## Misunderstanding

I didn't mean to say that. What I meant was...

Oh, I'm sorry for the confusion. What I actually meant was...

I'm so sorry, my message must have got lost in translation...


I think we've got our wires crossed!








# Don't Know

I'm not sure about that actually, but I can find out.

- I can't say for sure yet. But I'll get back to you and let you know.
- Your guess is as good as mine




# Don't want to talk
I'd rather not express my opinion on this issue


I'd rather not talk about this if that's okay

This topics hits close to home. It's tough for me to talk about.

That's a really personal question. I'm not comfortable answering that.

I've think you're overstepping boundaries with that question. I'd rather not answer that.


This isn't the time or the place to get into this discussion.

(For women)
I'm only going to tell you this once; keep your hands to yourself.










# Controversial topic

I know not ewveryone agrees with me, but

I know this is a contentious issue...

It might be an unpopular opinion, but I strongly believe...

I don't see eye-to-eye with everyone on this matter, but I think it's really important to discuss this.

Whilst you may not agree with my views, I'mt definitely interested in hearing yours.

I'm not trying to ruffle anyone's feathers here...








You are in over your head

It's pretty hard to express my ideas about this in English, but I'll try my best.




Sorry, I'm afraid I don't follow you.

That went straight over my head! Could you explain it in a different way?

I'm not entirely sure what you mean.

I have to admit, this is a little beyond me.

I don't know much about this topic.
I'm not well-versed on this topic.


Wow, I've never really thought about this before
	/ but I'm enjoying listening to you talk about it









## Upsetting someone

You seem upset. Did I say something wrong?
That definitely didn't come out right. I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. I didn't intend it to come across that way.
I'm sorry, that was insensitive. I appreciate you calling me out on what I said.
