# Vulnerability Assessment
its main objective is to identify as many vulnerabilities in as many systems in the network as possible
focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities so that security deficiencies can be identified and effective security measures can be deployed to protect the network in a prioritized manner. Most of the work can be done with automated tools and performed by operators without requiring much technical knowledge.


La gestión de vulnerabilidades es vital para que la organización priorice las amenazas y clasifique el riesgo



CVE = common vulnerabilities and exposures

clasificacion e identificacion de las vulnerabilidades

CVSS (scoring system)


CVE = like a dictionary (doesn't provide additional info)
