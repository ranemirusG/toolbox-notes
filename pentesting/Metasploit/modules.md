# MSF Modules


## Exploit
Take advantage of a vulnerability

## Payload
Code

### Non-staged
Sent to the target as a whole along with the exploit.

(It uses forward slash in the name `/`. Example:
```
payload/linux/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
```
)

### Staged
Is sent to the target in two parts:

The first part (stager) contains the payload that is used to establish a reverse connection back to the attacker. Then download the second part of the payload (stage) and execute it.

(It doesn't use the forward slash `/` in the name
```
payload/linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
```
)



## Encoder
Used to encode payloads in order to avoid AV detecion. Example: `shikata_ga_nai` is used to encode Windows payloads.

## NOPS
Used to ensure that payloads sizes are consistent and ensure the stability of a payload when executed.

## Auxiliary
Additional functionality like port scanning and enumeration.


## Evasion
