# Services

Running services.

Explore which running processes and services may allow us to elevate our privileges. For this to occur, the process must run in the context of a privileged account and must either have insecure permissions or allow us to interact with it in unintended ways.

Unlike on Windows systems, on Linux we can list information about higher-privilege processes such as the ones running inside the root user context.
