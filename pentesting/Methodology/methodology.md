# Pentesting

Penetration testing can lead us in many different directions and while we should definitely follow up on the many different paths based on our interactions, we should stick to our schedule/plan most of the time to keep a disciplined approach.

An organization's most sensitive and important data may be stored in locations that do not require domain administrator privileges, such as a database or a file server. This means that obtaining domain administrator privileges should not always be the end goal during an assessment since we may be able to reach the "crown jewels" for an organization via other users in the domain.



1. Information Gathering
2. Enumeration
	- start with "low-hanging fruits"
	- "rinse and repeat" for every taken account
	- finding an actionable vector should not interrupt our enumeration process
3. Exploitation
4. Post-Exploitation
	- Local Enumeration
	- Privilege escalation
	- expand control into additional machines
	- upload files and tools to the target machine
	- Dump hashes
	- Mantaining persisten access
	- Pivoting
	- Clearing tasks
