## whois

`whois` is a TCP service, tool, and a type of database that can provide information about a domain name, such as the name server and registrar. This information is often public since registrars charge a fee for private registration.

- RFC 3912 
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS >
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server >
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar >
- Online tool: <https://who.is/>


Looks up the registration record associated with a domain name.
Domains are leased out by companies called Domain Registrars.
Many registrants subscribe to privacy services to avoid their email addresses being harvested.

Look for:
	- Registrar (ex: namecheap.com)
	- Name Server (ex: cloudflare.com)

Example: `whois megacorpone.com`


Reverse lookup: `whois [IP]`

## nslookup (Name Server Lookup)
RFC 1034

IP addresses associated with a domain name (and viceversa)

use: `nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER` or as an interactive prompt, just `nslookup`

### Options:
```
A		IPv4 Addresses
AAAA	IPv6 Addresses
CNAME	Canonical Name
MX		Mail Servers
SOA		Start of Authority
TXT		TXT Records
```

example:
`nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1`
`nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com`



find the authoritative name servers for a domain (NS query)
```
> nslookup
> set query=ns
> stackoverflow.com
```









## dig (Domain Information Groper)

Returns more info than `nslookup`
Allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains
Very useful tool for network troubleshooting

use: `dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`
```
dig tryhackme.com MX
dig tryhackme.com A
dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX
dig www.ekoparty.org +short
```
