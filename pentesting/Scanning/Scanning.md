## Host Discovery Techniques

### Ping sweep
```
ping -b -c 1 [Subnett address]

# example ip 10.10.10.1/24
ping -b -c 1 10.10.10.0

# example ip 20.20.20.1/16
ping -b -c 1 20.20.0.0


# fping (for any number of targets)
fping -a -g 10.10.10.0/24






# nmap
nmap -sn [IP]

## TCP SYN Ping
## send TCP SYN to port 80 on target. If closed the target respost with RST, if open responds with a SYN-ACK packet
## Beware that excluding the -sn option will make port discovery, and we don't want this doing Host Discovery. Also it takes longer if there are multiple IPs.
nmap -sn -PS [IP] # Default to port 80
nmap -sn -PS[PORT] [IP] # especify another port
nmap -sn -PS22 [IP]
nmap -sn -PS1-1000 [IP]



## TCP ACK Ping
nmap -sn -PA [IP] # Default to port 80



## ICMP Ping Scan
nmap -sn -PE [IP]
nmap -sn -PE [IP] --send-ip # local eth network?




```

- Nikto
Nikto is a vulnerability scanning tool that is designed specifically to assess web servers.




- Nessus / OpenVAS
	OpenVAS can conduct web security tests



- shell script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..255}; do
        timeout 1 bash -c "ping -c 1 20.20.20.$i" >/dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "El host 20.20.20.$i está activo"
        fi
done
```









### Security Headers

- <https://securityheaders.com/> It will analyze HTTP response headers and provide basic analysis of the target site’s security posture. We can use this to get an idea of an organization’s coding and security practices based on the results. 


### SSL Server Test
- <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/> This tool analyzes a server’s SSL/TLS configuration and compares it against current best practices.




### Manually test server

HTTP sends and receives data as cleartext (not encrypted); therefore, you can use a simple tool, such as Telnet (or Netcat), to communicate with a web server and act as a “web browser”. The key difference is that you need to input the HTTP-related commands instead of the web browser doing that for you.

```
telnet $IP PORT
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: telnet
```

```
nc $IP PORT
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: netcat
```
