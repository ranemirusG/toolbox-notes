# NANO
It's a really cool editor and has lots of tricks.
It's also very well documented so I'm just going to mention a few.

## Line numbers (toggle)
```
esc + n
esc + #
alt + n
alt + #
```
or run `nano -l [FILE]`


## Save
ctrl + s



## Multiple files
`nano FILE1 FILE2`
toggle between the buffers with `alt+,` and `alt+.`
