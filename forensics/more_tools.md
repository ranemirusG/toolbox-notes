#KAPE
KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) is a free and open-source digital forensics tool developed by Eric Zimmerman). Designed to automate the collection and parsing of forensic artefacts from a computer's file system and memory. KAPE can be deployed locally or on remote systems to quickly gather key data. This allows analysts to begin investigating while the lengthy process of taking a disk image is being conducted. KAPE can retrieve artefacts relating to browser usage, program execution, the filesystem, logs, and much more.
