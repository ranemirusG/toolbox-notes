# ASCII Hex
It was the first character encoding standard for the web. It defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet:

- English letters (A-Z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .


This option transitions data between ASCII and hexadecimal representations. For instance, the word "ASCII" can be converted into the hexadecimal number "4153434949". Each character is converted from its numeric ASCII representation into hexadecimal.
