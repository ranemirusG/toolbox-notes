# Hash

Hashing is the process of converting data (usually of variable length) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal value.

A hash is a unique string value that corresponds to the contents of the file. They are generated by hashing algorithms, such as Message Digest 5 (MD5) or Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256). If two files are exactly the same, the hash will match. But if even one character is different, the files will have unique hash values.





## Linux
`md5sum [FILE]`
`sha256sum [FILE]`



## PowerShell

```powershell
Get-FileHash [FILE] # By default, the hashing algorithm will be SHA256
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 [FILE]

Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 [FILE]
```

- To compute the MD5 hash of a string:
 ```powershell
 $stringToHash = "Hello, World!"
 $md5Hash = Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -LiteralPath (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $stringToHash -Force | Out-File 
temp.txt -Encoding ASCII)
 ```

- To compute the SHA-256 hash of a string:
 ```powershell
 $stringToHash = "Hello, World!"
 $sha256Hash = Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $stringToHash -Force | Out-File 
temp.txt -Encoding ASCII)
 ```
 
 
 
 
 


## Cracking Hashes:

Hashes are one-way functions, which means they cannot be directly reversed to obtain the original data. 

To "crack" a hash, you typically use a process called "hash cracking" or "password cracking," which involves trying a large number of possible inputs (e.g., passwords) and comparing the resulting hashes with the target hash.

`John the Ripper` or `Hashcat` are commonly used for hash cracking. These tools have specialized algorithms and techniques to efficiently guess passwords and crack hashes.
