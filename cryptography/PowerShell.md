In PowerShell, you can encode, decode, hash, and sometimes crack hashes using various cmdlets and techniques. Here's a brief 
overview of each operation:

1. Encoding and Decoding:
   Encoding is the process of converting data into a specific format, while decoding is the process of converting it back to its 
original form.

   - To Base64 encode a string:
     ```powershell
     $stringToEncode = "{"id":1,"admin":true}"
     $encodedString = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($stringToEncode))
     ```

   - To decode a Base64-encoded string:
     ```powershell
     $encodedString = "VEhNe0JBU0U2NF9FTkNPRElOR30="
     $decodedBytes = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($encodedString)
     $decodedString = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($decodedBytes)
     ```

2. Hashing:
   Hashing is the process of converting data (usually of variable length) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically 
a hexadecimal value. Common hash algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

   - To compute the MD5 hash of a string:
     ```powershell
     $stringToHash = "Hello, World!"
     $md5Hash = Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -LiteralPath (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $stringToHash -Force | Out-File 
temp.txt -Encoding ASCII)
     ```

   - To compute the SHA-256 hash of a string:
     ```powershell
     $stringToHash = "Hello, World!"
     $sha256Hash = Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $stringToHash -Force | Out-File 
temp.txt -Encoding ASCII)
     ```

3. Cracking Hashes:
   Hashes are one-way functions, which means they cannot be directly reversed to obtain the original data. To "crack" a hash, you 
typically use a process called "hash cracking" or "password cracking," which involves trying a large number of possible inputs 
(e.g., passwords) and comparing the resulting hashes with the target hash.

   - Tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat are commonly used for hash cracking. These tools have specialized algorithms and 
techniques to efficiently guess passwords and crack hashes.

   It's important to note that cracking hashes without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Hash cracking should only be 
performed for legitimate and authorized purposes, such as testing the security of your own systems or during penetration testing 
engagements.

Please use these techniques responsibly and ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal authority to perform these actions 
on any system or data.
