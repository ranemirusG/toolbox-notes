# Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

Port 443
 

HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, and has the same functionality of retrieving content from web servers. However, the difference between the two is that HTTPS uses encryption to protect the transfer of data between a web server and a client. How do you turn HTTP into HTTPS? You need to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Sites that use HTTPS are less susceptible to man-in-the-middle and sniffing attacks.
