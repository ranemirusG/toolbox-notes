# DNS Protocol

Default Port: 53

DNS operates on TCP and UDP ports 53 and uses relational databases to convert human-readable hostnames and domain names (such as Google.com) into their respective IP addresses so that communications can be sent to and from these hosts. The reason we use domain names is that they’re easy to remember. You remember securityblue.team, but you probably won’t remember 3.9.68.12!
