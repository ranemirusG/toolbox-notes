# HTTP

Port 80

HTTP allows clients (browsers such as Chrome and Firefox) to connect to web servers and request content, which appears in the form of file downloads, web pages, and streaming services. So if you want to view the securityblue.team homepage, your browser will make an HTTP request to our web server, requesting to download the HTML web page. The server will respond with a 200 status code (which means “OK”, it has been successful) and then send the HTML page to the client, so you can view it on your screen. As HTTP is not encrypted, it is possible to conduct sniffing attacks, and see cleartext data as it is transmitted between the client and the server, such as passwords.
