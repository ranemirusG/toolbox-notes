# WebSocket

The WebSocket protocol enables full-duplex interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. 

Provides a simultaneous two-way communication channel over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.
